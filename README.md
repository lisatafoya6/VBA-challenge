# VBA-challenge
Note : I tried to save the file as vba file during office hours with the TA and he said as long as you should be able to read the text you will be good. It did not allow me to save it as any other type of file so I had to copy it into a text file. 




I received my code for max and min from kmaphanda in the Slack AskBCS Learning Assistant ASK-316747 WorksheetFunction.max
    WorksheetFunction.min
I also received this MaxValue code from a different Learning Assistant ASK-316742 I worked through this with them both and we still couldn't figure out how to get the correct maximum and minimum values to show :(
